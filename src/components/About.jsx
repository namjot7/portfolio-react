                <p>For the past year, I have been creating amazing front-end projects using JavaScript that are both interactive and responsive, such as a snake game, a Spotify clone, and an image editor. Moreover, I have also started learning Java and Data Structures and Algorithms to improve my problem-solving skills and logical thinking.</p>
